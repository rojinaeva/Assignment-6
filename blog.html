            <p>1.difference between let,var and constant?</p>

            <p class="blog-para">If you never want a variable to change, const is the keyword to use.
            If you want to reassign values:
               and you want the hoisting behavior, var is the keyword to use
                if you don't want it, let is the keyword for you</p>

            <p>1.difference between ragular function and arrow function?</p>
            <p class="blog-para">Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions. Hence, they can never be invoked with the new keyword</p>

            <p>1.difference between map,forEach,filter,find?</p>
            <p class="blog-para">The main differences between above examples is: filter() returns an array containing the element that satisfies the condition, but find() returns the element itself that satisfies the condition. In filter() , whole array is iterated despite the fact that the element being searched for is present at the beginning</p>

            <p>1.why use template string?</p>
            <p class="blog-para">Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements.</p>
